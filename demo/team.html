In IDSPL I have been working as Project Officer – Building Energy Simulations. I am specialized in the field of new and refurbished buildings (and more in general of the built environment) with high performances, high energy efficiency and limited environmental impact. I had an overall experience of three years (two years as an Architect and one year as energy simulations expert). I certify myself as a strongly innovative professional, able to manage the complexity of the very energy-efficient built environment: either because I master the tools and the cultural aspects required to guide a design process integrating different disciplines (multi-disciplinary) at different scales (multi-scalar), which is the only route to cost-effective solutions; or because I acquired the ability and the tools to model in detail the components of buildings from the point of view of structural behavior and building physics.
